Resources:

Pop-up menu: I used two resources for this. This W3Schools link showed me how to create the popup (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp), but I wanted it to appear automatically instead of getting it to show up by pressing a button - so I refreshed my memory on the "load" event listener using this link (https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onload.asp)
Hero image on index.html (I used this link to help me get the header to lay on the hero image): https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-get-hero-background-image-behind-the-menu/
For the text information, I used the nonprofit's Facebook page and current website.

Issues:
I was having issues with the footer, so this link helped me with that: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13881548/sticky-footer-hiding-content

I also had to do a lot of trial and error for the popup ad, but I was able to figure it out.

*Note - the non-profit does not currently have a Twitter, so the Twitter icon is just a placeholder link
